Hey! An important note here regarding ESLint.



When you will install developer dependencies, one of them will be eslint-config-prettier. New versions of this package have affected our ESLint configuration.

For that reason, ESLint config must be updated to avoid having a lot of errors (e.g. Unexpected block statement surrounding arrow body and Failed to load config "prettier/react").

Please do that for each project in the course:

1) Open .eslintrc

2) Find the following line:

"extends": ["eslint:recommended", "airbnb", "prettier", "prettier/react"],
3) Remove "prettier/react" from the list:

"extends": ["eslint:recommended", "airbnb", "prettier"],
4) Add two more lines to "rules":

  "rules": {
    ...your...other...rules...here...,
    "arrow-body-style": [0],
    "prefer-arrow-callback": [0]
  }
5) Save the file and restart the application.

Above will match the latest eslint-config-prettier requirements.
