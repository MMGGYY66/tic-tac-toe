Hey!

When you run the app locally with npm run start , you might see strange warning in the terminal which starts with:

Though the "loose" option was set to "false" ...

That is just a warning that can be safely ignored.

I know it is indeed annoying to see it.

To silence the warning, you have to add the following to package.json:

"babel":{
   "presets":[
      "nano-react-app"
   ],
   "plugins":[
      [
         "@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties",
         {
            "loose":true
         },
         "yt1"
      ],
      [
         "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods",
         {
            "loose":true
         },
         "yt2"
      ]
   ]
} 

After that, it's gone :)
