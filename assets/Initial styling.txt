Hey! An important note here!

In the next video, we finally start to develop an app. The tool that will power the project is going to be Parcel

The template that we install is called nano-react-app

The template adds the latest and unstable version of Parcel which is bad because it's the latest alpha version.

So in the next video right after running npx nano-react-app folderName please do the following to avoid having errors:

1) Open package.json

2) Find "parcel": "^2.0.0-alpha.3.2" (or whatever version you have) under devDependencies

3) Edit the line so it looks like that:

"parcel": "1.12.4",

4) Also in package.json add new resolutions section below "scripts" section:
